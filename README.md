# 📖 Semantic Book Recommender System (AI-Powered)

This project is an **AI-powered semantic book recommendation system** that finds books based on meaning, tone, and genre context rather than keyword matching...
Built with **Sentence Transformers**, **vector search**, and an **interactive Gradio interface**, it offers a modern and intuitive recommendation experience.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🔍 **Semantic Search (RAG-like Retrieval)**
